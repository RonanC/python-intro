###### Theory of Algorithms - Exercise 1
# Introduction to Python

In this exercise we will install Python, have a look at its usage, and write some simple programs.

## Exercises

1. Go to [python.org](http://www.python.org) and download the Python 3 installer for your machine, and run it.

1. Open [The Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/) and have a look at section 1 "Whetting your appetite". The Python Tutorial is a great resource for learning more about Python.


1. Save the following script as fib.py in whatever folder you want to keep it in. Run it at the command line.
   
    ```python
    while b < 10:
      print(b)
      a, b = b, a+b
    ```

1. Go to [this webpage](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jlawler/wordlist.html) and download the text file containing English words.

1. Read [Section 7.2. Reading and Writing Files](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#reading-and-writing-files) from the Python Tutorial.

1. Write a script to open the text file and print the first ten lines to the terminal.

1. Read [Section 3.1.2. Strings](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html#lists) and adapt your script to print the first ten words of length three from the file to the terminal.

## Advanced exercises

1. Write a script that creates a new text file from the original list of words, where the new file only contains all of the words of length three.

1. Write a script that asks the user for an integer i and outputs the i<sup>th</sup> word of length three from the file.

1. Write a script that asks the user for a three letter string and outputs all words that are anagrams of that string.
